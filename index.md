# About Me

Hi, I am Oguzhan Karaahmetoglu and I am a Data Scientist. Currently, I pursue my graduate studies at **Bilkent University** under the supervision of **Prof. S. Serdar Kozat**. I am currently employed as a full-time Data Scientist, where I am a part of an R&D team developing a spatio-temporal prediction framework. My research interests include **spatio-temporal prediction**, **online learning**, **point processes modeling**, **adaptive filtering** and **big data**.

I am most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>PyTorch</mark>
